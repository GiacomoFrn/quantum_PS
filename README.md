# Demonstration of quantum projective simulation on a single-photon-based quantum computer
This repository contains resources and tools related to https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12729. 

## Repository Contents
- `quantum_PS.ipynb`: This notebook allows you to play with the trained quantum projective simulation agent developed for this project. The notebook provides visualizations of the model structure, the possibility to upload the trained parameters and to visualize the final probability distributions for the task discussed in the manuscript.
- `utilities.py`: This file contains a few Classes used to define the quantum ECM for both stages of the transfer learning task.
- `environment.yml`: This file contains all the dependencies required to run the previous notebook
- `trained_parameters/`: This folder contains the trained parameters of the model for both stages saved as json files.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Set up the environment using the environment.yml file.
3. Open the Jupyter notebook in your preferred environment and begin exploring the functionalities.
